Initial impressions of Singapore are that it is ridiculously humid and there's
a lot of buildings with plants on them.

Mostly walked around the rest of the day. Photos of the famous Merlion at
night.

### 18 July

Visited Hell's Museum at Haw Par Villa. It was built by Aw Boon Haw, the same
person who created Tiger balm. Scary place.

Went for dinner at Satay Street at the famous Lau Pau Sat hawker centre.

### 19 July

Went to the Botanic Gardens in the morning, before it got too hot. Saw a couple
of very big monitor lizards. They can climb trees, which is a terrifying
thought.

Singapore is celebrating it's 60th birthday in August. In the evening they had
a big firework show as part of ongoing rehearsals.
