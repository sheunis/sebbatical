Intial impressions of Singapore are that it is ridiculously humid and there's a lot of buildings with plants on them.

### 18 July

Visited Hell's Museum at Haw Par Villa. It was built by Aw Boon Haw, the same person who created Tiger balm. Scary place.

Went for dinner at Satay Street at the famous Lau Pau Sat hawker centre.

### 19 July

Went to the Botanic Gardens in the morning, before it got too hot. Saw a couple of very big monitor lizards. They can climb trees, which is a terrifying thought.

Singapore is celebrating it's 60th birthday in August. In the evening they had a big firework show as part of ongoing rehearsals.
