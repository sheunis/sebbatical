#### 7 September

It's fairly obvious that Dharavandhoo is known for manta rays.

We went snorkelling at the local reef. Some of the fish we saw.

We went on a manta ray trip to Hanifaru Bay, but unfortunately the most exciting thing we saw was an eagle ray.

We went on another whale shark trip later in the day and managed to see two at the same time. Unfortunately it was getting dark at that stage and the light was quite bad, but I did manage to get some photos.
